\section{Definitions}
Let $q \geq 2$ be a fixed integer and $x$ be a sequence on $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}{ }^{3}$ Then $x$ is said to be $(\mathbb{C}, q)$-regular (briefly: $q$-regular or simply regular) if the $\mathbb{C}$-vector space generated by its $q$-kernel

$$
\left\{x \circ\left(n \mapsto q^{j} n+r\right): \text { integers } j \geq 0,0 \leq r<q^{j}\right\}
$$

has finite dimension. In other words, $x$ is $q$-regular if there are an integer $D$ and sequences $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{D}$ such that for every $j \geq 0$ and $0 \leq r<q^{j}$ there exist complex numbers $c_{1}, \ldots, c_{D}$ with

$$
x\left(q^{j} n+r\right)=c_{1} x_{1}(n)+\cdots+c_{D} x_{D}(n) \quad \text { for all } n \geq 0 .
$$
\\

By Allouche and Shallit the sequence $x$ is $q$-regular if and only if there exists a vector-valued sequence $v$ whose first component coincides with $x$ and there exist square matrices $A_{0}, \ldots, A_{q-1}$ such that

$$
v(q n+r)=A_{r} v(n) \quad \text { for } 0 \leq r<q \text { and } n \geq 0 .
$$

This is called a $q$-linear representation of the sequence $x$.
\\

One characterisation of a $q$-regular sequence is as follows: the sequence $x(n)$ is said to be $q$-regular if there are square matrices $A_{0}, \ldots, A_{q-1}$ and a vector-valued sequence $v(n)$ such that

$$
v(q n+r)=A_{r} v(n) \quad \text { for } 0 \leq r<q \text { and } n \geq 0
$$

and such that $x(n)$ is the first component of $v(n)$.
\\

In the standard literature these sequences are called $k$-regular sequences (instead of $q$-regular sequences).
\\

Regular sequences are intimately related to the $q$-ary expansion of their arguments.
\\

Remark: Let $r_{\ell-1} \ldots r_{0}$ be the $q$-ary digit expansion ${ }^{4}$ of $n$. Then

$$
x(n)=e_{1} A_{r_{0}} \cdots A_{r_{\ell-1}} v(0)
$$

where $e_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{llll}1 & 0 & \ldots & 0\end{array}\right)$

Whenever we write that $r_{\ell-1} \ldots r_{0}$ is the $q$-ary digit expansion of $n$, we mean that $r_{j} \in\{0, \ldots, q-1\}$ for $0 \leq j<\ell, r_{\ell-1} \neq 0$ and $n=\sum_{0 \leq j<\ell} r_{j} q^{j}$. In particular, the $q$-ary expansion of zero is the empty Word.
